\description{
Over the years, I developed a personalized style/theme \code{theme_lemmens}
for use in ggplot2. In
earlier versions, this theme, and some other personalizations were in my
.Rprofile that I synced across machines via Tresorit. \code{lemmens_geoms()}
an additional function that sets default values for various geoms that make
more sense with my default theme.
}
\details{
To make things a little clearer and more consistent with other (packages), almost
everything has been renamed. \emph{This will most definately break older scripts.}

\code{theme_lemmens} is my old \code{mytheme2} that is a cousin from
\code{mytheme} and
distinguishes itself by not using boxes and other decorating stuff around
ggplot2's facets. \code{theme_l} and \code{theme_lem} are abbreviations.

\code{lemmens_geoms(use = FALSE)} adapts default values for a series of geoms.
the \code{use} parameter defaults to FALSE, because I used bigger default
sizes in the days that I did not yet use Cairo. When the lemmens package is
loaded, \code{lemmens_geoms()} is automatically called.
